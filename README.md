General Old School Revival Material, being written relatively publicly. 

The __Northern Tier__ is a shadowy scientific organization that operates in small cells across the multiverse. It's goals are mysterious, but its actions are swift and its tools are first-rate: efficient mixtures of interwar technology and High Magic.

What if Bletchley Park's mechanical computers had been composed of thousands of interlocking *golems*? What if magnetic core computers were run by *lighting elemental* typists? What if *The Cave of the Blood God* was actually a hemoglobin-based supercomputer run on death energy, and the adventurers who delved into it LSD-addled graduate students?

This is the heart of a __Northern Tier__ campaign - the intersection between Old School Gaming and Taylorism, Conspiracy Theory, Pseudoscience, and interdimensional paradox.

In general, the material is written to be used with __Labyrith Lord__, __Mutant Future__, and the __Advanced Edition Companion__, all published by [Goblinoid Games](http://www.goblinoidgames.com/). These are an excellent OSR launchpad, especially due to their extremely generous and permissive licensing structure.

Huge thanks to to Daniel Proctor for his strong work reviving and jail-breaking the old school gaming experience.
