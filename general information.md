# General Information
The __Northern Tier__ is a shadowy scientific organization that operates across multiple planes of existence. Its operators function across multiple timelines, under a general policy of covert intervention. Even those at the higher levels of the organization are given only limited information. The equipment used by staff operates by opaque mechanism, though almost always horrible. It's best not to ask too many questions.

## Scope of Work
The __Northern Tier__ operates across dimensions. Field Office assignments may take staff to the far side of the multiverse, or place them in cosmological planes unfamiliar to their home-plane religions.

Most sentient beings in most worlds are *unaware* in the sense that they believe their reality to be the only one available to them, with limited exception for post-death travel to one or more afterlife domains.

One can assume that any employee who has worked in more than one field office is aware of the multi-dimensional nature of reality. 

## Management
Observers of the organization's activities could accurately characterize its operations as those of Lawful Evil Outsiders. While technically correct, the reader should appreciate the wide scope of acceptable behavior by __Northern Tier__ staff. Many entities in its employ are extraplanar beings of pure good and light, and just as many are demonic, chthonic, chaos-aligned, or otherwise factional.

Even within *arbeitsgruppen*, divergent alignments, home planes, and even cosmological defaults are the norm, not the exception.
