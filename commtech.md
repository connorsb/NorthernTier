Using communication technology is an inherently dangerous part of working with the Northern Tier.

Civilian comm tech is deeply insecure against astral, demonic, and super-scientific intervention and monitoring. An agent of the Northern Tier would be better off letting a project fail than to radio home using civilian tech.

Whenever communication technology is used, roll 2d6 on the following table, with the following modifiers (stacking):

Communication Device | Modifier
---------------------|-----------
Using Civilian technology (cell phones, pagers, email, public computers) | -6
Using Military communications equipment (encrypted radio, hardened computer terminals, satellite phones) | -4
Using Secret technology (CIA, FSB, Alien Tech, spells) | -2
Using Northern Tier Standard Issue | -0
Within negatively modified terrain (Evil, cursed, haunted, etc) | -3
Transdimensionally | -3
Between timelines | -6
From within a Circle of Power | +2
From within positively modified terrain (blessed, sacred, pure, etc) | +3
Using Northern Tier Heavy Infrastructure (outpost comms room, heavy duty field radio emplacement, portable fortress) | +6
Mutant Future tech: [GO LOOK AT SOURCE BOOK] | Various

-5 or lower: Operator, Hell Calling
  Your communications channel has allowed something horrible to enter this world. Roll 2d6 again on the following chart, using the same modifiers
  Final Roll | Creature Summoned
  -----------|------------------
  Below -10 | Demon Lord or Old One
  -10 | Balor
  -9|  Shoggoth (is there a writeup for this?)
  -8| Nightmare
  -7| etc

-4 to -2: Static Scream
	Your communication channel is immediately overwhelmed by the howling static of the dead. Any extraplanar or aberrant creature of 6 HD or higher, within a 5 mile radius has the opportunity to immediately send you a Sending (per the spell), as well as a Fear spell (save vs. death to negate), caster level equal to the creature's HD.

  If no creatures choose to send such missives, the party instead falls under the effects of a fear spell (save vs. death to negate) cast by a 6th level magic-user, as each person in turn interprets the static as a specific and horrible directive aimed just at them.

This whole section is of course modeled on the rules for encounter reactions, but, you know, horrible. The intent is to have very crunch rules for the LL, but to try not to really reveal to the players that their antagonists are usually old-school monsters using old-school spells, until those things are right on top of them.

Note that it's real damn possible to summon a Great Old One, if you try to make a call to another timeline from a haunted house with no protection.
